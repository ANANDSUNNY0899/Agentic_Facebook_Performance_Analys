# Kasparro Agentic Facebook Performance Analyst

A fully autonomous multi-agent system that analyzes Facebook Ads performance, explains ROAS/CTR fluctuations, and generates new high-performing creative ideas — all using a structured, explainable, agent-driven pipeline.

This project was built as part of the Kasparro Applied AI Engineer Assignment, following their guidelines for:

Agentic reasoning

Quantitative validation

Creative generation

Structured prompts

Clean architecture

Human-readable marketer reports




# Why This Project Exists

 Modern marketing teams struggle with:

  Unclear why ROAS dropped
  Too many campaigns to manually evaluate
  Creative fatigue not detected early
  No structured explanation or direction
  No system that both analyzes data and generates creative fixes

This project solves these by using a multi-agent AI system that thinks, analyzes, validates, and creates — all on its own.


# System Architecture

 User Query  -→  Planner Agent  --> Data Agent (summaries, trends, CTR/ROAS) -->  Insight Agent (hypothesis generation) --> Evaluator Agent (quantitative validation + evidence) --> Creative Improvement Agent (new creatives + CTAs + A/B plan) -->  Final Report
             
Each agent has one job, making the system easy to reason about, debug, and extend.

# Features
✓ Multi-Agent Reasoning

Each agent performs a specific responsibility.
This keeps reasoning clean and transparent.


✓ Data-Driven Ad Diagnosis

The system identifies:

CTR drops

ROAS fluctuations

Creative fatigue

Audience mismatch

Spend anomalies

✓ Quantitative Hypothesis Validation

Not just “I think”, but backed by numbers:

Before/after CTR

% change

ROAS shifts

Confidence scoring

✓ Creative Recommendations

The system generates 5 new creative ideas for each low-performing campaign:

emotional angles

urgency hooks

value propositions

problem–solution framing

strong CTAs

A/B test-ready variants

✓ Human-Friendly Marketing Report

A final, clean report.md suitable for marketers and executives.

# How to Run

### **1. Place dataset here:**
   data/synthetic_fb_ads_undergarments.csv

### **2. Run from pipeline:**
   python src/run.py "Analyze ROAS drop"



### **3. Outputs will be generated in:**

reports/
 insights.json
 creatives.json
 report.md

logs/<run_id>/


# Sample Output
  samples/sample_output_run.txt



You’ll see:
   agent-by-agent flow
   insights discovered
   creatives generated
   logs created
   full report generated


# Agents (Human Explanation)
 # Planner Agent

“Hmm… what does the user want? What steps should we follow?”

Creates a clear plan with:

time windows

thresholds

task flow

# Data Agent

“Let me open the dataset and compute everything.”

loads CSV

CTR & ROAS calculation

recent vs prior windows

identifies low CTR campaigns

# Insight Agent

“Based on the data… here’s what might have happened.”

Creates hypotheses:

creative drop

fatigue

audience mismatch

spend shift

Follows Think → Analyze → Conclude reasoning.

# Evaluator Agent

“Let's check whether the hypothesis is actually true.”

Runs quantitative checks:

before vs after CTR

% change

confidence score

verdict: supported / not supported / inconclusive

# Creative Agent

“Campaign ka CTR low hai? Let’s fix it!”

Generates:

emotional creatives

urgency hooks

value-driven lines

CTAs

A/B plan

These are tailored to undergarment niche marketing.

# Outputs Explained
   insights.json

Structured, evidence-based hypotheses with confidence.

   creatives.json

New creative ideas + A/B testing plan.

 report.md

A clear, simple, marketing-friendly summary.

# Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

Numpy

Agent-based architecture

Structured prompting

Clean JSON outputs

Lightweight, extendable, and production-friendly.
